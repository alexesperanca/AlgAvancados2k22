"""
This module provides the :class:`OverlapGraph` class.
This class includes diverse strategies that uses Hamiltonian methods for faster sequence analysis, sequence obtainment from graphs, and suffix/prefix iteration such as:
    - Creation of an overlap graph that essentially constructs a graph based on the portion of sequences that overlap each other (prefix and suffix)
    - Get original sequence from a path of fragmented sequences by considering their overlap
